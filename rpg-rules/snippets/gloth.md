### Name: Gloth, the Putrid Ooze

#### Description:

Imagine a living mound of decaying flesh, pulsating with an unnatural green light. Gloth's form is constantly shifting, its edges dripping with a noxious slime that leaves a putrid stench in its wake. Tentacles, resembling writhing entrails, lash out from its amorphous mass, each tipped with razor-sharp teeth. A single, bulbous eye, bulging from its center, oozes tears of acidic mucus. Gloth emits a constant gurgling sound, a horrifying symphony of digestion and decay.

#### Strengths:

- Amorphous form makes it difficult to target and damage.
- Corrosive slime weakens armor and inflicts painful burns.
- Can engulf and digest smaller creatures whole.
- Regenerates quickly, making prolonged battles challenging.

#### Weaknesses:

- Slow and lumbering, easily avoided in open spaces.
- Vulnerable to fire and magical purification spells.
- Can be tricked into engulfing objects instead of players.
- Blind spot directly behind its pulsating eye.

#### Tactics:

- Gloth ambushes from dark corners or emerges from polluted swamps.
- Uses its tentacles to grapple and restrain prey, slowly dissolving them with its acidic touch.
- If threatened, it may engulf itself in a protective mass of slime, waiting for an opportunity to strike.

#### Flavor:

Gloth is a walking nightmare, embodying the horrors of decay and corruption. Its mere presence inspires revulsion and despair in those who encounter it. The air around it crackles with an unnatural energy, and the ground beneath its oozing form becomes slick and treacherous.

#### Additional Notes:

Consider adding specific lore to Gloth, perhaps connecting it to a dark ritual or a cursed artifact.
You can adjust its difficulty and abilities based on the level of your players.
Remember, the key is to evoke disgust and fear with vivid descriptions and unsettling details.
